## Description
Once running Python (on the command line, through and IDE or a notebook), you can try running some basic commands. Remember the commands you are able to run and even syntax can change based on the version of Python you are working, we will work with the newest version of Python (3.9.7). To execute code in the command line, simply press `enter`. In an IDE or notebook, use `shift+enter`.
