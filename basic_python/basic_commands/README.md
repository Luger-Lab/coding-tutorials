## Description
Once running Python (on the command line, through and IDE or a notebook), you can try running some basic commands. Remember the commands you are able to run and even syntax can change based on the version of Python you are working, we will work with the newest version of Python (3.9.7).   

## Print
One of the most basic commands and one of the most helpful for debugging your code is the `print` command. It is functionally similar to `echo` in Bash, however the syntax is different.
    ```
    print("hello world")
    ```
The quotes here specify that "hello world" is a string and not another object that Python should look for the value of. You should be able to print the value of any string, int, float, variable, list, dictionary or other object using this syntax.
## Variables
## Lists
## Sets
## Dictionaries
