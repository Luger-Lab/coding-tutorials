## Description
Once running Python (on the command line, through and IDE or a notebook), you can try running some basic commands. Remember the commands you are able to run and even syntax can change based on the version of Python you are working, we will work with the newest version of Python (3.9.7). To execute code in the command line, simply press `enter`. In an IDE or notebook, use `shift+enter`.

## Print
One of the most basic commands and one of the most helpful for debugging your code is the `print` command. It is functionally similar to `echo` in Bash, however the syntax is different.
    ```
    print("hello world")
    ```
The quotes here specify that "hello world" is a string and not another object that Python should look for the value of. You should be able to print the value of any string, int, float, variable, list, dictionary or other object using this syntax.

## Variables
To assign a variable simply type the name of the variable, the equals sign and then the value you wish to assign. This variable can be: a integer, floating point, string, or boolean.

    var1 = 15
    print(var1)
    15

You can change the value of a variable by using the same syntax again and simply imputing a new value.

    var1 = "hello world"
    print(var1)
    hello world

You can check the type of a variable using:

    type(var1)
    <class 'str'>
